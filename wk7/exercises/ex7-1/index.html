      </header>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Both llamas and alpacas are part of the camel family. They are two of the four lamoid species the other two being vincu√±a and guanaco their wild cousins. Llamas and alpacas are from South America, primarily in Peru and Boliva, and have been bred by humans for thousands of years for transportation and fleece. While these two species are related they are different in many ways.</p>
        <section>
          <h2>Size</h2>
          <p>The most noticeable difference between them is their sizes. Alpacas are smaller, around 35 inches high at the shoulder and between 121 to 143 pounds. Llamas are much larger growing to around 47 inches at the shoulder and about 250 pounds.</p>

          <h2>Face</h2>
          <p>Their faces are also dissimilar. Alpacas have small, blunt faces with short ears. Llamas have more elongated faces with banana sized ears.</p>

          <h2>Hair</h2>
          <p>Another key difference is their hair. Alpacas have shaggy hair that is used for fleece production. Their hair color can vary greatly, from whites and light yellows to browns and blacks. Llamas' hair is coarser, and their wool is considered inferior.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>Disposition</h2>
          <p>Humans usually use llamas as pack animals, since they can carry a generous amount of weight. The average llama can carry a load of 45 to 60 kg (99 to 132 pounds) for up to 30 km (18.6 miles) each day. Yet llamas get a bad reputation, since, when overloaded or maltreated, they react by spitting, kicking, lying down, or refusing to move. Usually, however, they are gentle creatures. Alpacas, on the other hand, are a bit more timid and like to stay with their herd. Llamas can be used as guard animals for livestock like alpacas and sheep.</p>
